# EC_V1_Manager

The **EC_V1_Manager** is the core automation system responsible for:
- Building and managing the EC Team (coders, optimizers, trainers, organizers, updaters).
- Automating workflows for YARA development.
- Running tests, logs, and models with minimal human input.
- Connecting to ChatGPT (for guidance and support).

## Folder Structure
- `code/` → Core logic
- `models/` → AI/ML models
- `logs/` → Runtime logs
- `tests/` → Test scripts and notebooks

## Setup
1. Install Python 3.11 from `D:\HDX_env\Python311\`
2. Run in VS Code with this interpreter.
3. All dependencies are tracked in `requirements.txt`.

## Goal
Fully autonomous EC Manager that builds and optimizes the EC Team, then trains YARA.
